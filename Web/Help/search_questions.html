<p>There are in an about a maximum of 4000 <a href = "questions.html">Questions</a> per <a href = "category.html">Category</a>. So it is very difficult to go to the particular <a href = "questions.html">Question</a> whenever required. The <a href = "search_questions.html">Search Questions Utility</a> allows the <a href="admin.html">Administrator</a> to search through the <a href = "questions.html">Questions</a> by name so that he can easily get the required <a href = "questions.html">Question</a>. </p>
<p>The search operation is performed by <a href = "category.html">Category</a> or by <a href = "questions.html">Question Type</a>. If you know the <a href = "category.html">Category</a> of the <a href = "questions.html">Question</a> then you can select the <a href = "category.html">Category</a> from which to search or you can select the <a href = "questions.html">Question Type</a> of the <a href = "questions.html">Question</a> from which to search. Selecting both <a href = "category.html">Category</a> and the <a href = "questions.html">Question Type</a> restricts the search for the selected <a href = "category.html">Category</a> and the selected <a href = "questions.html">Question Type</a>.</p>
<p>In the results column there is the short version of the question displayed with the rank of the search and the type of the <a href = "questions.html">Question</a>. The rank of the result indicates the priority of the result. Greater the rank, higher the priority and more matching the result would be with your search text. It is important to know the <a href = "category.html">Category</a> and the <a href = "questions.html">Question Type</a> before performing any operations on the <a href = "questions.html">Questions</a>.</p>
<p>With the help of the radio buttons at the side of each resultant <a href = "questions.html">Questions </a>one can select the <a href = "questions.html">Question</a> for a particular operation by clicking the buttons provided below. One can <a href = "edit_questions.html">Edit</a> or <a href = "del_questions.html">Delete</a> the selected <a href = "questions.html">Question</a> one at a time. It is important to have the required Access Rights while performing these operations. </p>
<p>The search operations are performed in the Database and hence requires some time for loading to initiate the process. The search engine is imported and has restricted facilities, so the search will provide the results only when there are no spellings mistakes however minor they may be. So if a particular search doesn't give any result then try to recall the spelling or make appropriate changes in the search text accordingly. Also It is important to know that the search for the phrases in the <a href = "questions.html">Question</a> is carried out strictly by word to word. Hence even if there are minor changes in one word with the other being precise, the results will vary or there might be no results at all. Also as the search operation is not case sensitive you need not care about the cases of the words or the phrases.</p>
<p><span class="style2">Note</span> : It is important to know that <a href = "search_questions.html">Search Questions Utility</a> comes under the <a href = "question_mgmt.html">Questions Management</a>. So one who has no access to the <a href = "question_mgmt.html">Questions Management</a> will have no access to <a href = "search_questions.html">Search Questions</a>.</p>
