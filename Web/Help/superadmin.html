<p>The <a href = "superadmin.html">SuperAdministrator</a> is the highest position among all the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a> and allows you to control the entire system. The <a href = "superadmin.html">SuperAdministrator</a> has the authority to access any part of the system. The <a href = "superadmin.html">SuperAdministrator</a> is responsible for creating other <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a>, controlling the <a href = "accessibility.html">Access Rights</a>  and changing the <a href = "designation.html">Designation </a>of the <a href = "admin.html">Administrators</a>.  It is especially helpful in assigning WebAdmin tasks to selected users.

<p>You can also assign Sub-Administrators quotas for the accounts they create or the disk-space they use. This is useful if you want to limit the capabilities of a SubAdmin.
