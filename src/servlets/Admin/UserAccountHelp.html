  When the <strong>"Edit User"</strong> Button is clicked in the User Updation Page a JSP page is called with 
  all the values of the user selected from the list of the users. Admin can then modify (or 
  leave the values as it is) and can Update the User Profile in the DataBase.

  When the <strong>"Delete User"</strong> Button is clicked in the User Updation Page a Servlet is called  
  which deletes the specified user from the database. A Warning is given before deleting the 
  selected user.
